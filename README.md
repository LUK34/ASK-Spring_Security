# 1. Key Security Principles (Easy Notes)

### 1.1.Least Privilege
- Give users and systems only the minimum access they need to do their job, nothing more.
- In Spring Security, this means roles like USER, ADMIN should access only their allowed endpoints.

### 1.2.Secure by Design
- Security should be built into the application from the start, not added later as a fix.
- Spring Security follows this by blocking everything by default unless you explicitly allow it.

### 1.3.Fail-Safe Defaults
- If something goes wrong or is unclear, the system should deny access by default, not allow it.
- Example: If a URL is not configured in Spring Security, access is denied automatically.

### 1.4️.Secure Communication
- All data exchanged between client and server should be encrypted and protected.
- This is why Spring applications use HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and secure headers.

### 1.5️.Input Validation
- Never trust user input—always validate and sanitize it before processing.
- Prevents attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, even before Spring Security checks authorization.

### 1.6️.Auditing and Logging
- Track who did what and when in the system for security and troubleshooting.
- In Spring Security, this helps log login attempts, access failures, and sensitive actions.

### 1.7️.Regular Updates and Patch Management
- Keep frameworks, libraries, and dependencies up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- Using the latest Spring Security version protects you from already-fixed security flaws.

# 2. Heart of Spring Security

### 2.1 Client Sends Request
- A user sends a request (login request or API call) from browser/Postman.
- Example: /login or /api/orders

### 2️.2 Request Enters the Security Filter Chain
- The request first goes into the Filter Chain (pink box).
- This is a series of security checks that run before your controller.

### 2.3️ Authentication Filter Intercepts the Request
- The Authentication Filter checks:
- Is this a login request?
- Does it contain username & password?
- If yes, it creates an Authentication object and forwards it.

### 2.4️.AuthenticationManager Takes Control
- The AuthenticationManager is the main decision maker.
- It decides which AuthenticationProvider should handle the request.

### 2.5️. AuthenticationProvider Validates User
- DaoAuthenticationProvider does the real work:
- Calls UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername()
- Fetches user details from the Database
- Username, password hash, roles are loaded here.

### 2.6 PasswordEncoder Verifies Password
- The PasswordEncoder:
- Encrypts the incoming password
- Compares it with the stored encrypted password using matches()
- If passwords match → authentication success
- If not → authentication fails.

### 2.7 SecurityContext Is Updated
- If authentication is successful:
- User details are stored in SecurityContext
- Spring Security now knows who the user is
- This is how Spring knows the logged-in user across requests.

### 2.8 ️Request Reaches Controller
- Now the request is forwarded to Your Application Controllers.
- Controller executes normally because the user is authenticated.

### 2.9 Response Goes Back Through Filters
- The response travels back through the filter chain and reaches the client.

# 3. Form Base Authentication

- **Project : SS_1_FB_4.x.x for Java 17 and above**
- **Project: SS_1_FB_2.7.6 for Java 1.8**

- The defualt authentication in spring security is FORM BASED AUTHENTICATION.
- 1. Without Spring security
```
URL: localhost:8080/hello
```
- 2. With Spring security when you execute the above url. The url will redirected to default spring security/
```
URL: localhost:8080/login
```
- 3. to access the application you need to take the password from the console of your sts ide.
```
Username: user
Passwrod: 6cce3dba-98d8-4f3c-b4cf-2ae5bdd8dfd0
```
- 4. After step 2. If you want to logout. there is a logout page as well that can be accessed.
```
URL: localhost:8080/logout
```
- 5. **---- IMPORTANT ----**
- If you want to setup a default password. Then in the properties file setup the user password.
- e.g:
```
spring.security.user.password=hello_world
```
- 6. After updating the property and try accessing the above url.
```
URL: localhost:8080/hello
```
- 7. You will be redirected to login page.
```
URL: localhost:8080/login
Username: user
Passwrod: hello_world
```
- 8. ** ---- IMPORTANT ----**
- Same as step 5. But we add username also.
```
spring.security.user.name= hello
spring.security.user.password=hello_world
```
- 9. After updating the property and try accessing the above url.
```
URL: localhost:8080/hello
```
- 10. You will be redirected to login page.
```
URL: localhost:8080/login
Username: hello
Passwrod: hello_world
```

# 4. Basic Authentication using SecurityFilterChain

- **Project : SS_2_SecurityConfig_4.x.x**
- **Project: SS_2_SecurityConfig_2.7.6**

- This module uses Spring Security (SecurityFilterChain) with HTTP Basic Authentication to secure REST endpoints.
- It is designed for internal, closed-network applications and supports browser-based API access without a login UI.
- **✅ Authentication Mechanism**
- **Type:** HTTP Basic Authentication
- **Login Page:** ❌ Not used
- **Browser Behavior:** Native username/password popup
- **Session Handling:** Browser caches credentials
- **Use Case:** REST APIs, internal dashboards, IE11-compatible environments

- **📌 Security Configuration Highlights**
- Uses SecurityFilterChain (Spring Security 6 compliant)
- WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter is not used (deprecated)
- CSRF protection is disabled for REST compatibility
- Static resources are publicly accessible
- All other endpoints require authentication

- **📂 Publicly Accessible Paths**
- The following paths are excluded from authentication:
```
/css/**
/js/**
/images/**
/kng/**
/error
```
- These are typically used for static assets and shared UI resources.

- **🔒 Secured Endpoints**
- All other endpoints require authentication
```
GET /hello → Requires Basic Auth
```
- **👤 Default User Configuration**
- Authentication credentials are configured in application.properties:
```
spring.security.user.name=hello
spring.security.user.password=hello_world
spring.security.user.roles=USER
```
- These credentials are suitable for development or internal environments only.
- For production, consider database-backed authentication or SSO.

- **🧪 How to Test (Browser)**
- Open:
```
http://localhost:8080/hello
```
- Browser will prompt for credentials

Enter:
```
Username: hello
Password: hello_world
```
- On success → API response is displayed
- On failure → 401 Unauthorized

# 5. In Memory authentication
- **Project: SS_3_InMemory_2.7.6**
- **Project: SS_3_InMemory_4.x.x**

- **1. What is In-Memory Authentication?**
- In-Memory Authentication means:
- Users are stored inside application memory
- No database, No LDAP, No external service
- Users are lost when the application restarts
- Best for:
- Learning, Proof of Concepts
- DEV / UAT
- Internal tools
- Not suitable for:
- Production, Large user bases, Password rotation / audit requirements

- **2️.Line-by-Line Explanation**
- Bean Declaration
```
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService()
```
- Declares a Spring bean
- Spring Security automatically detects this bean
- Once detected, default authentication is disabled
- Spring now uses YOUR users instead of auto-generated ones

- Creating a User Object
```
UserDetails user1 = User.withUsername("user")
```
- Creates a UserDetails object
- UserDetails is Spring Security’s standard user model
- user is the login username

- Password Definition
```
.password("{noop}user_world")
```
- {noop} → No encoding
- Password is stored as plain text
- Required so Spring knows how to validate
- Without {noop}, authentication fails
- Works on Java 8 / 11 / 17

- Assigning Roles
```
.roles("USER")
```
- Assigns role USER
- Internally becomes:
```
ROLE_USER
```
- Spring Security always prefixes roles with ROLE_
- Building the User
```
.build();
```
- Finalizes the UserDetails object
- Immutable after creation
- Admin User
```
UserDetails admin = User.withUsername("admin")
```
- Same logic as user1, but with:
```
.roles("ADMIN")
```
- Internally:
```
ROLE_ADMIN
```
- Registering Users in Memory return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user1, admin);
- Stores users in an in-memory map
```
Key = username
Value = UserDetails
```
- Thread-safe
- Fast lookup

- **3️. How Authentication Works at Runtime**
- Request Flow (Basic Auth Example)
- Client calls:
```
GET /hello
```
- Browser sends:
```
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2VyX3dvcmxk
```
- Spring Security:
- Decodes Base64
- Extracts username & password
```
Calls UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername("user")
```
- InMemoryUserDetailsManager:
- Finds user
- Compares passwords
- Checks roles
- Authentication succeeds → controller is executed

- **4. Role Usage Example**
- Securing Endpoints
```
.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
    .anyRequest().authenticated()
)
```
- Role Mapping
```
Role defined	Spring internal
USER	ROLE_USER
ADMIN	ROLE_ADMIN
```
- **5. Why {noop} Is Required**
- Spring Security does not allow plain text passwords by default.
- {noop} explicitly says:
```
“I know what I’m doing. Do not encode.”
```
- Without it:
- IllegalArgumentException: There is no PasswordEncoder mapped for id "null"

- **6️. When NOT to Use In-Memory Authentication**
- ❌ Production
- ❌ Compliance environments
- ❌ User self-registration
- ❌ Password policies

- **7️. When It’s Perfect**
- ✔ Learning Spring Security
- ✔ REST API testing
- ✔ Internal hospital tools
- ✔ Offline / intranet systems



# 6. ROLE BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
- **Project: SS_4_RBAC_2.7.6**
- **Project: SS_4_RBAC_4.x.x**

- For Java 17 and 4.x.x. Apply `@EnableMethodSecurity ` on top of the config class
```
@Configuration
@EnableMethodSecurity // for RBAC -> for Java 17 and above
public class SecurityConfig 
{
...
}
```

- For Java 1.8 and 2.7.6. Apply `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)` on top of the config class
```
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true) // RBAC -> for Java 1.8 and 2.x.x ONLY
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig 
{
...
}
```

- Did not use DB for this. Define the roles in properties like below:
```
# -----------------------------------------
# Spring Security
security.role.user=USER
security.role.admin=ADMIN
# -----------------------------------------
```

- After that we have to import these properties using SpEL not using @Value annotation.
- We are basically creating ROLES that will access certain URLs.
```
	//SpEL -> Cant use @Value annotation, wont work
	@PreAuthorize("hasRole(@environment.getProperty('security.role.user'))") 
	@GetMapping("/user")
	public String user_end_point() 
	{
		return "Hello from USER.";
		
	}

	//SpEL -> Cant use @Value annotation, wont work
	@PreAuthorize("hasRole(@environment.getProperty('security.role.admin'))") 
	@GetMapping("/admin")
	public String admin_end_point() 
	{
		return "Hello from ADMIN.";
		
	}
```

# 7. ROLE BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC) +H2 DB
- **Project: SS_5_RBAC_H2_2.7.6**
- **Project: SS_5_RBAC_H2_4.x.x**
- The main objective is instead of using InMemory Authentication. We are going to use h2 db.
```
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# H2 Database Configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# JDBC URL (in-memory)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

# Custom username & password
spring.datasource.username=h2user
spring.datasource.password=h2password

# H2 Driver
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver

# H2 Console
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
#E.g: localhost:8080/h2-console

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# JPA (Hibernate)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

- h2 db for 4.x.x and 2.7.6 uses iframes. So make sure to enable the frames in security layer.
- To enable the iframe settings use the below code:
```
      // ----------------------------------------------------
            // H2 Console   
       // ----------------------------------------------------   
               /*
                h2Console runs on frames.But spring security will block the frame.
                So we have to enable by writing the below lines of code.             
               */
               .headers(headers ->
                  // headers.frameOptions(frame -> frame.disable())
                   headers.frameOptions(frameOptions -> frameOptions.sameOrigin())
               )
            // ----------------------------------------------------
            
```
- for 2.7.6 add this below `.authorizeRequests()`
```
.antMatchers("/h2-console/**").permitAll() //h2 access given here as well
```

- for 4.x.x add this below 
```
.requestMatchers("/h2-console/**").permitAll() //h2 access given here as well
```

# 8. RBAC + H2 Db -> save the details to Db
- **Project: SS_5_RBAC_H2_2.7.6**
- **Project: SS_5_RBAC_H2_4.x.x**
- Inorder to save the user into db. We need to use DataSource field Injection.
```
	@Autowired
	DataSource datasource;
```
- Database Authentication details save into the DB.
```
    	// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    	/*
    	 	Database Authentication -> Replace In-memory 
    	 */
    	JdbcUserDetailsManager userDetailsManager = new JdbcUserDetailsManager(datasource);
    	userDetailsManager.createUser(user1);
    	userDetailsManager.createUser(admin);
    	return userDetailsManager;
    	// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
- For the time being in h2 db. We are going to use the ddl queries defined by `Spring Security in Github`
- define the queries in a file called `schema.sql`
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR_IGNORECASE(50) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR_IGNORECASE(500) NOT NULL,
    enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE authorities (
    username VARCHAR_IGNORECASE(50) NOT NULL,
    authority VARCHAR_IGNORECASE(50) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_authorities_users
        FOREIGN KEY (username)
        REFERENCES users (username)
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix_auth_username
    ON authorities (username, authority);
```
- We use Bcrypt password to encrypt the password:
```
  //To encrypt the password and save into DB we use passwwordEncoder
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder()
    {
    	return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
```
